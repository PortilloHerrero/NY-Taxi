# New York City taxi (Prices prediction project)
New York taxi data set is a compilation of almost 12 millions rows. It consists
of 18 columns with diverse information from NY city taxis that go from pick up
locations to number of passengers.
The goal was to predict the total amount charged to customers and what were
the main features that generate that price.
In order to be able to predict taxi prices and see what were the main features
impacting them we worked with a multiple linear regression model and a
gradient boosting model (XGBRegressor).
We wanted to compare how both models work and what their strengths and
weaknesses were.
